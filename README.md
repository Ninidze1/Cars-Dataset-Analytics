# Used Car Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of used cars. Through this analysis, we aim to understand trends, distributions, and patterns in the used car market.

## How It Works:
1. The data is first loaded into a DataFrame using the `pandas` library.
2. Various data manipulation operations are performed on this DataFrame, including extraction, indexing, filtering, and sorting.
3. Basic statistical functions are applied to understand the central tendency and spread of car prices.
4. Data visualizations are created using the `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries to represent the data graphically.

## How to Use:
1. **Setup**: Ensure you have Python installed and the required libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`). You can install these libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
    ```
2. **Clone/Download the Project**: Clone this repository to your local machine or download the project files.
3. **Data File**: Place your data CSV file in the project directory or update the file path in the code accordingly.
4. **Run the Script**: Navigate to the project directory in the terminal and run:
    ```bash
    python script_name.py
    ```
    Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the Python script containing the code.
5. **View Results**: After running the script, you'll see the visualizations displayed and any console outputs if present.

### Code File Comments:
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv("path_to_file.csv")

# Data Extraction: Extract desired rows and columns
extracted_data = df.loc[specific_rows, specific_columns]

# Data Indexing: Index the data by the 'Name' column
indexed_data = extracted_data.set_index('Name')

# Data Filtering: Filter cars based on 'Location' and 'Year'
filtered_data = df[(df['Kilometers_Driven'] == specific_kilometers_driven) & (df['Year'] >= specific_year)]

# Data Sorting: Sort data based on 'Year' and 'Price'
sorted_data = filtered_data.sort_values(by=['Year', 'Price'], ascending=[False, True])

# Statistical Analysis: Calculate statistics for the 'Price' column
mean_price = df['Price'].mean()
median_price = df['Price'].median()
# ... (other statistical calculations)

# Data Visualization: Create bar and line charts
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
# ... (code for bar chart and line chart)
```
